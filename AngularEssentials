Angular
1. Important: FormsModule is Required for Two-Way-Binding!
2. @component decorator: viewEncapsulation(shadowdom)
3. #ref: known as ocal refrences, available within html template onl
4. @ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static: true}) serverContentInput: ElementRef;
omit   {static: true} if angular < 8
5. ngcontent: to put the content betn custom tag <app-cust> something </app-cust>
now in app-cust html template wherever we put <ngcontent></ngcontent> something will be rendered

6. Behind the scene of *ngIf on div => <ng-template [ng-if]="condition" > 

7. <router-outlet> is a directive not a component

8.insted of route.snapshot use route.params.subscribe as snapshot will not recive data from url if we are on the same page
